Sometimes the users sent too many requests to the server which can cause 429 error. The mechanism of
asking the client to slow down the rate of requests is commonly called rate limiting, and it is done 
to prevent DOS attack (Denial of service attack)

we can add the rate limiting mechanism using upstash which is a serverlss data platform

1- from upstash create database give it a name and data location


2- copy the upstash/redis url and paste it on .env.local
    UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=https://brief-prawn-11229.upstash.io

3- copy the upstash/redis token and paste it on .env.local

4- Add these two keys to config file

5- run: npm install @upstash/ratelimit --legacy-peer-deps

6- run: npm install @upstash/redis --legacy-peer-deps

7- on database create a new file called redis.ts
import config from "@/lib/config";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";


const redis = new Redis({
    url: config.env.upstash.redisUrl,
    token: config.env.upstash.qstashToken,
})

export default redis;


8- on the lib create a new file called ratelimit.ts
import redis from "@/database/redis";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit"; 

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis,
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(5, "1m"),
  analytics: true,
  
  prefix: "@upstash/ratelimit",
});

export default ratelimit

9- add the logic to signIn and signUp functions on the auth.ts file from actions.
    const ip = (await headers()).get("x-forwarded-for") || "127.0.0.1";
    const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);
    if (!success) return redirect("/too-fast");

10- on the app create a new folder called too-fast which has page.tsx file
